//function basic setup 

//razzle becomes a pointer to some stored potential work (the function)
//the pointer "invokes" the function by using the () after the pointer
// call the function by using "razzle()" in the terminal
// you can write these after you call them 
// functions can be passed arguments or given default arguments

  //Implement a function called saturdayFun. It should return a String like "This Saturday, I want to ....!" Fill in the ... with the activity that's passed in as the first parameter.

// Return a function that is an "inner" function

// Defines a function called actionApplyer

  //JavaScript's ability to call functions before they appear in the code is called hoisting.
  //For hoisting to work, the function must be defined using a function declaration.
  //expressions produce a value
  //interpret a function using a grouping operator () - puts everything in parenthases
  //grouping operator is usually used in arithmetic operations to tell the JavaScript engine to evaluate the value that's inside it first.

 // (function() {
   // console.log("Yet more razzling");
  //}) 

  //anoynumus function is a function without a name
  //if you do not assign a name to a function there is no way to call it
  // can only use anoynmus functions as a callback function
  //you'll often see anonymous functions passed as an argument to an event listener:
  //Our anonymous function is being passed as an argument to addEventListener.
  //The JavaScript engine "stores it away" as work to be executed later, when the button is clicked.

  //defining a variable called button that selects the button in the document
  //add the click event listener to the button - pass in an anoynmus function as an argument
  // everytime a button is clicked, print "yet more razzling"
  //const button = document.getElementById('button');
    //button.addEventListener('click', function() {
    //console.log("Yet more razzling");
